## Scope and lineage

Active projection of leaf [#67](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67), parent [#53](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53), prerequisite [#66 / PCM-0025](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/66) CLOSED/COMPLETED. Working branch: `task/PCM-0026-task09-local` in the permanent checkout (receipt slices #80–#97 landed through earlier task branches; #67 names `task/PCM-0026-post-push-plan` as the planning-owner branch). Primary writer: owner/Astra planning with owner-authorized subagent execution replacing the Windows staff model on this device (owner direction 2026-09-25).

The bounded scope was post-push receipt identity, retry/lost-response/partial-parent-update handling, safe actor/lineage checks, and deterministic failure tests. The opt-in lookup-before-post route merged in #80–#97; [OWNER-17](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67#issuecomment-5824990832) released TASK-09 (disabled admission evaluator) as a local candidate. The [owner freeze decision](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67#issuecomment-5827958268) closes automatic first-send/publisher work in favor of the merged manual+opt-in contract; crash-safe automation continues only through [#110](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/110).

Completed:
- Recorded RESULT-09 + correction on #67, owner freeze decision closing automation scope, and synchronized task projection; admission evaluator commits dede388/4159087 ready for publication.

Evidence:
- https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67#issuecomment-5827724217 and #issuecomment-5827958268; focused suite 22 OK on python3.12; ruff/mypy/compileall/validate clean.

Decisions:
- Freeze automatic first-send receipts per owner direction 2026-09-25; opt-in manual receipts remain the operating contract; #110 owns ambiguity completion.

Changed:
- tasks/TASK-PCM-0026-github-receipts.md; src/continuity/receipt_admission.py and tests/test_receipt_admission.py (new, from candidate commits).

Blocked/uncertain:
- None.

Next:
- Push task branch, open PR to main with Refs #67, enable auto-merge, verify required checks, then publish leaf/parent receipts and close #67.

## Handoff

Research note: `docs/research/PCM-0026-issue-67-retry-safe-receipts.md`. Opt-in `--receipt-repo`, `--receipt-issue`, and `--receipt-parent` look up comments before posting, refuse secret-like bodies, and stop when another writer holds the marker. Default checkpoint behavior is unchanged. RESULT-09 and its correction: [comments 5827724217 and 5827958268](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67#issuecomment-5827958268). Pending: publish `task/PCM-0026-task09-local` (evaluator commits `dede388`, `4159087`), PR/CI/auto-merge, receipts, then close #67 per the owner freeze decision and reconcile #53 lineage.
