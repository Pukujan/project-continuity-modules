# TASK-PCM-0022 — Test agent-facing PCM behavior with fresh-session holdouts

- Status: active
- Owner: Codex current PCM session; GitHub issue #39
- Priority: P1
- Depends on: issue #34 for corrected-candidate fresh-session rerun; baseline evidence is already recorded there
- GitHub issue: [#39](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/39)
- Branch: `task/PCM-0022-agent-facing-holdouts`

## Goal

Establish a fair, repeatable, risk-based testing method for PCM's agent-facing workflow promises. Keep issues focused on user outcomes; tests are evidence for delivery, not the deliverable or a reason to expand governance.

## Scope

- Set a lightweight issue contract: problem, scope/non-goals, observable outcome, and proportionate verification.
- Keep deterministic tests as the default; specify when fresh-session holdouts, metamorphic/property tests, and differential tests are useful.
- Define an oracle/fairness protocol for fresh-session tests and record evidence in a reusable format.
- Add deterministic tests for the durable policy and test the existing #34 baseline against it where possible.
- Do not implement managed worktrees or other #34 behavior in this task. The corrected-candidate rerun depends on #34.

## Out of scope

- Separate PDD, SDD, or TDD documents for every issue.
- Sub-issues for each testing technique.
- Hidden tests for every task or subjective LLM-only scoring.
- Changes to Eval Lab, hades-v2, harness-on-steroids, or inference-recommendation-engine.

## Verification plan

- Focused deterministic policy/contract tests.
- Full test suite, Ruff, MyPy, compile check, package build, continuity validation, and diff check.
- Fresh-session holdout only for agent-facing acceptance cases; use isolated baseline/candidate and a fresh variant, with the candidate run after #34 changes are available.
- Keep the human-verifiable outcome explicit; passing CI alone does not close the work.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-23 — activation

Completed:
- Reviewed PCM's operating contract, project checkpoint, specification, handoff/lifecycle/versioning guidance, package configuration, and CI workflow.
- Recorded the user-approved issue-level testing and ownership clarifications on GitHub issues #32 and #39.

Evidence:
- `git status --short --branch` before activation -> clean `main...origin/main`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` -> separate Ruff, MyPy, compile, Python 3.11/3.12 tests, PCM validation, package-build, and auto-merge jobs.
- GitHub issue #39 -> risk-based testing, oracle safeguards, and governance-overhead limits recorded.
- GitHub issue #32 -> remote Git authority, issue-log ownership, project goal, and temporary local/session work distinguished.

Decisions:
- Start PCM-0022 before previously queued PCM-0019 because the user selected the testing-policy slice; keep #34 implementation separate.
- Use the remote Git repository for canonical code/project history; use GitHub issues as the actionable-work ledger; sessions/local state are temporary.
- Keep issue-level test plans concise. Do not require every testing technique or separate process artifact on each issue.

Changed:
- `tasks/TASK-PCM-0022-agent-facing-holdouts.md`
- `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`

Blocked/uncertain:
- Corrected fresh-session candidate run depends on issue #34; the recorded blind attempt is one baseline observation only.

Next:
- Commit and push this policy slice, open a PR for required CI/auto-merge, then rerun the corrected-candidate holdout after #34 is delivered before closing #39.

### 2026-09-23 — policy and fairness checks

Completed:
- Added a compact testing policy that starts with the human outcome, distinguishes default deterministic tests from risk-triggered holdouts, and explains when metamorphic and differential checks fit.
- Added blind-test oracle safeguards: visible requirements, observable checks, inconclusive handling for ambiguity, isolated snapshots, and no LLM-only scoring.
- Carried the short rule into canonical and generated agent instructions; added deterministic policy tests.
- Inspected `content-generation-modules` on GitHub for human-first writing patterns. Its issue list is empty; its guidance and merged PR descriptions—not hypothetical issue practice—are the relevant reference.
- Astra's research on issue/file freshness is captured in the durable #33 comment and cross-checked against the already-existing PCM-0015 implementation plan.

Evidence:
- `python -c "import sys,unittest; sys.path.insert(0,'src'); s=unittest.defaultTestLoader.discover('tests'); r=unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(s); raise SystemExit(not r.wasSuccessful())` -> 24 tests passed.
- `ruff check .` -> passed.
- `mypy src` -> passed, no issues.
- `python -m compileall -q src tests` -> passed.
- `continuity validate --root .` (invoked through the source CLI) -> VALID.
- `git diff --check` -> passed.
- `python -m build --outdir %TEMP%\\pcm-0022-build` -> sdist and wheel built.
- Independent #34 corrected-candidate fresh-session rerun -> not yet possible; #34 implementation is separate and not done.

Decisions:
- Human-first issue updates follow the content-system pattern: problem/consequence, outcome, evidence/boundary, and next action; no images unless they explain an outcome.
- Keep the broader file-freshness implementation within existing #33 and the issue-tracking lifecycle within #32; do not create duplicate umbrella plans.
- The #34-candidate holdout is a remaining acceptance dependency, so #39 must stay open until that result is captured.

Changed:
- `docs/TESTING_POLICY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `templates/v1/software/AGENTS.md`
- `templates/v1/minimal/HANDOFF.md`
- `tests/test_agent_facing_testing_policy.py`
- `tasks/TASK-PCM-0022-agent-facing-holdouts.md`
- `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`

Blocked/uncertain:
- The corrected-candidate blind rerun depends on issue #34. The package build's small outputs remain in `%TEMP%\\pcm-0022-build`; cleanup was denied by the command safety policy. An empty `src/project_continuity.egg-info` directory remains after its generated files were removed.

Next:
- Commit and push the policy slice, open a PR for required CI/auto-merge, then rerun the corrected-candidate holdout after #34 is delivered before closing #39.
