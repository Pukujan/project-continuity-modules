## Human outcome

A failed or repeated checkpoint should not create duplicate history, and a new
session should be able to find the earlier document it needs without guessing
or recreating it. If a relevant file changed after the earlier session read it,
PCM should flag that specific evidence for review while leaving unrelated
records alone. The task handoff should point to the exact files and next action
needed to continue.

## Source and baseline evidence

- GitHub issue [#33](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/33)
  is the authoritative task scope. Its research comment on issue/file drift
  recommends revision-bound evidence, targeted review warnings, and a bounded
  issue-A/issue-B overlap experiment; it explicitly rejects a graph database as
  a first step.
- Activation snapshot: branch `task/PCM-0018-document-discovery`, based on
  merged commit `85f13464c466ff277ce319850ce8124c4bc95c52`; issue #33 is OPEN.
- `src/continuity/cli.py::checkpoint_task` currently appends a new timestamped
  checkpoint on every invocation. `publish_checkpoint` currently requires a
  staged checkpoint change, so retrying after the local commit or a successful
  push cannot complete as a clean no-op.
- `pack_task` currently reads PROJECT, CURRENT, TASK and always adds SPEC/AGENTS
  when present; it has no document inventory, deterministic lookup, task-scoped
  document selection, or per-source content evidence.
- Before task activation, the checkout was clean and was the only registered
  worktree. GitHub confirmed issues #31, #34, and #39 closed; #33 remained open.
  `checkpoints/CURRENT.md` and `HANDOFF.md` incorrectly still said to wait for
  issue #31's closeout PR, so those pointers are corrected in this task start.

## Fresh-session blind trial

### Visible prompt and scoring

Each independent session gets only a clean repository snapshot and the visible
GitHub issue #33; the hidden implementation diagnosis and prior chat are
withheld. The same prompt is used for baseline and candidate:

> You are taking over a PCM maintenance task in a new session with no chat
> history. Use only this clean checkout and the visible GitHub issue #33,
> “PCM-0018 — Prove idempotent checkpoints and fresh-session document
> discovery.” Read the repository’s normal project and current/task guidance,
> then report briefly: the relevant existing paths to read, the next actionable
> step you can justify, what context you successfully located, and what remains
> uncertain. Do not edit anything, create duplicate docs, commit, push, open a
> PR, or spawn other workers. Do not rely on other chat sessions.

Score the returned report against issue #33's visible requirements and the
repository's declared task state. Keep the expected paths and prior-run results
out of the prompt; record outcomes, uncertainty, elapsed time, and cleanup after
the candidate has completed so it cannot learn its answer from this test log.

## Existing research and provenance

The issue's linked research result is the design provenance for the overlap
case. It cites primary W3C definitions: [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/)
models provenance relations but does not establish truth;
[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) validates a supplied RDF graph against
shapes but cannot discover Git drift by itself; and
[OWL 2 Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) describes ontology
semantics/inference rather than required-field validation. These limits support
keeping runtime state in Git plus JSON/Markdown and using narrow content hashes
for freshness rather than adding an RDF service or reasoner.

## Scope and boundaries

In scope:

- Add retry-safe checkpoint request identity and payload conflict detection,
  including publishing retries across local commit and remote push outcomes.
- Add one optional machine-readable document inventory and a deterministic
  generated human-readable index with one declared source of truth.
- Add deterministic document lookup, explicit neighboring-record discovery,
  task-specific pack selection, exact next-action inclusion, and targeted
  stale-evidence warnings tied to the content/revision read.
- Add reproducible baseline/candidate fresh-session trials and record their
  prompts, rubric provenance, observable results, resource cleanup, and cost.
- Bump the CLI/package minor version if the new public commands require it;
  keep the protocol version unchanged unless implementation proves a required
  canonical-state incompatibility.

Out of scope:

- RDF storage, graph databases, OWL reasoning, vector search, an automatic
  whole-repository semantic crawler, locks on shared files, or broad memory
  platform work.
- PCM-0009's target-repository remediation, README image recovery (#42),
  archiving helper conversations (#30), or main-session rotation (#35).
- Any edits to Eval Lab, hades-v2, harness-on-steroids, or
  inference-recommendation-engine.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] An explicit request ID makes checkpoint retries idempotent; identical
  payloads return the existing event, conflicting reuse fails before writing,
  and the event timestamp/history remain unchanged.
- [ ] Publication retries push an existing local commit or safely confirm an
  already-pushed event without making a duplicate commit or checkpoint.
- [ ] The inventory owns stable document IDs, paths, human title/summary,
  search terms, explicit neighbors, task associations, and reviewed content
  identity. The readable index is rendered from it and cannot drift silently.
- [ ] Lookup returns deterministic matches plus declared neighbors and reports
  a changed dependency as `needs_review`; an unrelated-file control stays
  current. Reviewing/refreshing one entry does not rewrite history.
- [ ] A task pack selects only base project/current/task state plus its declared
  relevant documents, includes the exact next action, and records the commit
  and hashes of the content it actually includes. Dirty selected sources must
  not be mislabeled as an immutable HEAD snapshot.
- [ ] The selected checkpoint operation and generated view are idempotent;
  contract tests cover repeat, conflict, lost-push retry, duplicate history,
  search ordering/neighbor relations, stale/unrelated changes, and pack sources.
- [ ] CI verifies the inventory schema and human-view synchronization along
  with the existing quality, test, package, and artifact-parity checks.
- [ ] A blind baseline demonstrates the visible-contract starting behavior;
  a separate fresh-session candidate gets only the visible issue/repository,
  finds the seeded earlier document and neighbors, and does not duplicate
  canonical records. Objective checks, uncertainty, elapsed time, and closure
  of disposable resources are recorded.
- [ ] A reproducible checkpoint/catalog cost measurement is recorded; do not
  add machinery beyond the measured discovery and retry promises.
- [ ] All local/hosted gates pass, PR merges automatically, GitHub issue #33
  closes only after merged task/checkpoint/handoff evidence, and no temporary
  worktree or blind-test worker remains open.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-23 — implementation contract and first measurement

Completed:
- Implemented request-keyed checkpoint entries and retry-safe local commit/push behavior.
- Added an optional document inventory, generated human index, deterministic lookup, content-based freshness checks, and task-scoped context packs.
- Added deterministic tests for lost push responses, content conflicts, remote overlap/deletion, unrelated changes, squash-merge ancestry, Windows line endings, record-order metamorphism, generated-view drift, and package parity.
- Seeded PCM's own catalog with the earlier PCM-0015 plan/research and relevant policy/schema records so later sessions have discoverable examples.

Evidence:
- The full unittest suite passed on Python 3.11.15 and 3.12.10: 64 tests on each runtime. Both package smoke runs passed on both runtimes for wheel and sdist, including PCM-0018 features. `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, and `python -m compileall -q src tests` passed.
- `python tests/measure_pcm0018_overhead.py` on Windows 11 / Python 3.12.10 (100 checkpoint events; 12 indexed documents; 25 lookups) measured checkpoint append p50 17.028 ms / p95 23.272 ms, a 232-byte request-operation marker, and 923 average bytes of task growth per event. The 12-record JSON inventory was 5,718 bytes; its human index was 6,715 bytes. Lookup p50 was 73.482 ms / p95 81.559 ms.
- The first lookup measurement was 699.200 ms p95; batching remote content reads reduced it to 81.559 ms p95 in the same fixture. These are local fixture measurements, not universal performance guarantees.
- `continuity docs render --root . --check` passed. `continuity validate` rejected the disposable baseline checkout while it was detached rather than on the task branch; remove that checkout and rerun validation on the canonical checkout before delivery.
- The scored baseline is recorded in “Fresh-session blind trial”; the candidate remains pending.

Decisions:
- Keep the inventory optional so repositories that do not need explicit
  document discovery keep their existing initialization and pack behavior.
- Compare reviewed file bytes with the fetched remote default-branch tree;
  do not require Git commit ancestry because squash merging can preserve the
  reviewed bytes while changing commit ancestry.
- Treat missing remote information as `REMOTE_UNKNOWN`; compare all selected
  records in one batched Git object read to avoid one Git process per result.
- Keep task retrieval as deterministic metadata search plus explicitly
  declared one-hop neighbors. The human index is generated from the JSON
  inventory and labels its freshness as local-only.

Changed:
- PCM-0018 CLI, package version metadata, schemas, docs/templates, tests,
  measurement script, task log, document catalog/index, CURRENT, and HANDOFF.

Blocked/uncertain:
- Hosted CI has not run because there is no PR yet. Final continuity validation
  must be repeated after removing the disposable detached baseline checkout.
- Fresh-session candidate remains pending.
- Remote freshness is based on the fetched local cache of `origin/HEAD`; the
  command does not fetch and must label missing comparison evidence unknown.

Next:
- Commit the tested implementation, run the fresh-session candidate on that
  exact commit, remove its disposable checkout, and rerun continuity
  validation before pushing for GitHub CI.

### 2026-09-23 — activation

Completed:
- Verified issue #33 is open and selected it as the next active task after
  merged PCM-0017/issue #31.
- Read the PCM project contract, operating instructions, current state,
  handoff/testing contracts, relevant schemas, the PCM-0015 plan, and existing
  checkpoint/context-pack implementation.
- Corrected stale “wait for #31 closeout” instructions while activating this
  task.

Evidence:
- `git status --short --branch` -> clean task branch at merged commit
  `85f13464c466ff277ce319850ce8124c4bc95c52` before task-record changes.
- `git worktree list --porcelain` -> only the permanent checkout is registered.
- `gh issue view 33 --repo Pukujan/project-continuity-modules` -> issue #33
  OPEN with checkpoint retry, discovery, focused pack, and blind-test scope.
- Direct code inspection confirms checkpoint append has no request-key lookup,
  publication rejects no-diff retries, and packs have no document lookup.
- Prior investigation and primary-source citations are linked from issue #33's
  research comments; no new graph platform is needed for this bounded proof.

Decisions:
- Keep GitHub/main as accepted project authority; treat the local task branch
  as execution state. This sequential task uses the permanent checkout, not a
  new worktree.
- Preserve PCM-0009 and other target repositories as separately scoped work.
- Add file-overlap freshness as a narrow acceptance experiment because the
  existing issue research found it is the missing condition for trustworthy
  fresh-session discovery.

Changed:
- `tasks/TASK-PCM-0018-document-discovery.md`
- `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`

Blocked/uncertain:
- The final catalog shape and the exact compatibility boundary for additive
  CLI metadata are to be confirmed by tests before implementation.
- Issue #33, its implementation PR, required CI, and automatic merge remain
  pending.

Next:
- Define the checkpoint request-ID and document-catalog contracts against the
  existing schemas/tests, then implement the smallest compatible CLI changes
  and deterministic regressions.

## Handoff

Read `PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`, this task, `SPEC.md`,
`docs/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/TESTING_POLICY.md`, and `docs/VERSIONING.md`.
Use only the canonical PCM checkout. Do not modify unrelated target projects.
