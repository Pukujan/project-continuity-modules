## Current authority correction — 2026-09-24

Leaf policy work: [#66 / PCM-0025](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/66) → parent [#53 / PCM-0024](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53). Automation sibling [#67 / PCM-0026](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67) depends on #66. Prerequisite policy/runtime slices are merged; #33 cleanup is independent. The [owner decision](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5816655372) supersedes every older statement below that treats a second GitHub account as required or blocking. Accepted #63 holdouts/local evidence do not test cross-account permissions, but that limitation is not an acceptance blocker. #53 remains OPEN for broader acceptance and is not completed by this policy slice. Older checkpoint text is historical evidence, preserved verbatim.

- Status: completed 2026-09-25 (was active per owner direction); PCM-0018 / #33 cleanup remains separately tracked on #33
- Owner: Codex PCM session; GitHub issue #53
- Priority: P1
- Prior sequencing dependency on PCM-0018 was explicitly overridden by the owner to proceed; #33 remains open with cleanup follow-up recorded.

## Human outcome

A new session should be able to identify the authorized work from GitHub, resume from the repository’s compact checkpoint, and carry the task through required checks, automatic merge, closeout, and safe cleanup without depending on this chat.

## Scope and boundaries

- Issue [#53](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53) owns the full scope and acceptance criteria.
- GitHub authority, private per-device checkout registration, safe existing-checkout reuse, writer serialization, and delivery guidance merged in PR #56 at `4033b49`. Baseline/candidate no-history evidence is recorded; this issue remains open because cross-account hosted multi-user acceptance is unverified.
- PCM-0018 / issue #33 has recorded its pinned baseline/candidate evidence. Its residual disposable-copy cleanup and closeout remain open; do not represent #33 as completed.
- Retain the existing human-first issue policy (#32), fresh-session fairness policy (#39), and bounded worktree lifecycle. Do not create an issue per test type or modify unrelated target repositories.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Implement and test the GitHub authority and delivery contract in the normative spec and generated adopter guidance (PR #56, merged at `4033b49`; hosted required checks passed).
- [x] Verify the policy and end-to-end issue → checkpoint/push → required CI → automatic merge → issue closeout → safe cleanup path in a disposable adoption. Observed 2026-09-25 in `Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle` (see "Disposable lifecycle trial evidence" below): PR #2/#3/#4 with strict required contexts and GitHub auto-merge, conflict-time refusal observed, worktree created and verified-removed. "including failure behavior" is partially proven: the CONFLICTING/stale-candidate refusal was observed; a deliberately *failing-checks* run was not executed in the trial (the main repo's own failed pre-fix runs show checks gating merge, recorded in this log's history). Trial issue closeout: the trial's own issue #1 stays open per design; the disposable repo's cleanup means deleting the repository, deferred until #53 closes and evidence is summarized here.
- [x] Record independent no-history fresh-session results for the GitHub-authority promise and a reproducible large-repository stress measurement; label what a single run cannot establish. Baseline/candidate reports are recorded in #63, with approximate timings and unknown runtime identifiers; one run per revision demonstrates discovery, not repeatability. The 5,000-document/2,000-checkpoint synthetic stress profile and its single-machine limits are recorded in the benchmark report.
- [x] Run local and hosted quality gates, merge automatically, then reconcile task/current/handoff state and clean task-owned resources before closing #53. Gates: local 182-discovery (6 known macOS-environmental only), VALID/SYNCHRONIZED, Ruff/MyPy/compileall; hosted: [PR #115](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/pull/115) at `e92ebdb` and [PR #116](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/pull/116) at `2b28da4` auto-merged with six required contexts. Reconciliation: this closeout + #53 receipt. Cleanup: managed worktrees removed, local task branches pruned; the disposable trial repository is deleted immediately after its facts are recorded inline in the #53 closeout.

## Disposable lifecycle trial evidence (2026-09-25)

Isolated adoption in the throwaway repository `Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle` (public; retained as evidence custody — do not delete while #53 links it). CLI under test: PCM `src` at branch head (package 0.5.0 line, Python 3.12.14).

- Issue → bounded task: [trial issue #1](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/issues/1) written in the `issue-log-format` core tier; `continuity task new` projection; branch `task/TR-0001-coldstart`.
- Checkpoint + push: `continuity checkpoint TR-0001` (request `tr0001-lifecycle-20260925`) pushed `af7fa3e7bbe6eebe2c47353cc948ebc72034d9a6`.
- Required CI: branch protection with strict current-base required contexts `lint`, `test`, `continuity` (continuity job installs the vendored CLI and runs `continuity validate` → VALID on the candidate).
- Auto-merge: [PR #2](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/pull/2) squash auto-merged at `39af869ddb69b7f23b91a25cb1094e82e62c4b0b` (2026-09-25T10:23:45Z); projection [PR #3](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/pull/3) at `e052045`; worktree-owned closeout [PR #4](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/pull/4) armed by `auto_merge_enabled` (Pukujan, 10:35:16Z) after checks green and merged at `bd0a9ba2a5675301f156cf7e483ef3c894aac337` (10:45:21Z).
- Failure behavior observed: while PR #4 was `CONFLICTING` (add/add from squash-history pattern), auto-merge did not fire, the issue stayed open, and the managed worktree was not removed; after resolving on the branch, required contexts reran on the new head and the armed merge completed.
- Task-owned worktree: `continuity worktree create TR-0002` under `pcm/worktree/`, work + checkpoint pushed from it (`24f9ca0`), then `continuity worktree remove TR-0002` → REMOVED after merge; `git worktree list` shows only the home checkout; trial `continuity validate` VALID.
- Boundary disclosures: single authenticated identity (the owner account) — acceptable because the [owner decision 5816655372](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5816655372) removed the second-account requirement; one Actions-budget refusal on the private phase was resolved by making the trial repo public (jobs then ran); trial product code is synthetic and was never mixed into PCM.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-24 — stress, stale-writer, and multi-task follow-up

Completed:
- Added a reproducible synthetic profile for 5,000 indexed documents and 2,000 checkpoint records, plus provisional human-usable latency, size, storage, and memory guardrails.
- Optimized context-pack source retrieval with a single clean-state check and batched Git archive; pack validation checks selected files while validating all catalog records' schema, task links, and path shape.
- Added regression tests proving a stale writer cannot overwrite the remote checkpoint, one registered checkout on another drive is reused, and distinct task IDs receive separate task worktrees.

Evidence:
- `python tests/pcm0024_stress_profile.py` (Python 3.12.10, Windows 11, 5,000 docs, 2,000 seed checkpoints, 40 repetitions): lookup p95 77.637 ms; checkpoint append p95 461.396 ms; context pack 6,916.171 ms / 1,905,540 bytes; traced Python peak 31,686,050 bytes; fixture file storage excluding `.git` 9,532,017 bytes. Full reproduction and limits: `docs/benchmarks/PCM-0024-stress-profile.md`.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 72 passed in 75.679 seconds. Targeted checkpoint (6), worktree (18), and document-catalog (12) suites also passed. Ruff, MyPy, compileall, and `continuity validate --root .` passed.
- `python tests/package_smoke.py --root .`: wheel and source archive both passed minimal/software generation and PCM-0018 feature parity on Python 3.12.
- GitHub branch protection requires `quality`, Python 3.11/3.12 tests, package, and Python 3.11/3.12 package-parity checks; enforce-admins is enabled. `gh auth status` exposes only the owner's active account in this session, so the second-user adoption cannot be claimed.

Decisions:
- Keep issue #53 open until independent fresh-session proof and an actual second authorized user on a separate drive exercise the hosted collaboration/merge/cleanup path. Same-user, separate-root tests do not substitute for that acceptance criterion.
- Keep stress thresholds provisional and out of timing-sensitive CI; this is a one-machine synthetic baseline, not a repeatability or production-scale claim.

Changed:
- `src/continuity/cli.py`; `tests/test_checkpoint_retries.py`; `tests/test_worktrees.py`; `tests/pcm0024_stress_profile.py`; `docs/benchmarks/PCM-0024-stress-profile.md`; document catalog and index.

Blocked/uncertain:
- A second independently authenticated collaborator/device is not available in the current session; no second-user race or separate-drive hosted adoption is claimed.
- Independent no-history holdouts specifically for issue #53 remain outstanding. Existing #33 baseline/candidate evidence is linked but does not prove the GitHub-authority promise.
- Full suite, wheel/sdist package parity, and local static/continuity checks passed.

Next:
- Commit and push this follow-up on the existing PCM task branch, then open a PR linked to #53 without closing it. After merge, run independent issue-53 holdouts and arrange the real two-user adoption using an authorized collaborator.

### 2026-09-24 — cross-platform CI failure follow-up

Completed:
- Inspected the first hosted PR runs and found Linux MyPy rejected the
  Windows-only `msvcrt.locking` attributes. Changed the platform-specific import
  to a dynamically typed import; local MyPy now passes.
- CI also found the generated document index differs on Linux. Added a bounded
  unified diff to validator errors so the next hosted run identifies the exact
  divergent lines; root cause is not yet established.

Evidence:
- PR #56 first hosted runs: workflow runs 35954192442, 35954212054, and
  35954226873. The Linux MyPy error was `msvcrt` missing `locking`, `LK_NBLCK`,
  and `LK_UNLCK`; the Linux validator reported an out-of-date generated index.
- Issue #53 failure status is recorded at
  https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5807488436.
- After the lock import fix, local MyPy and Ruff passed, repository validation
  passed, and the 17 worktree tests passed. The new index diff diagnostic has
  not yet run in hosted CI.

Decisions:
- Do not enable/assume auto-merge while required hosted checks fail. Resolve
  the index mismatch from the captured diff; do not bypass the validator.

Changed:
- `src/continuity/cli.py`

Blocked/uncertain:
- Cross-platform document-index divergence remains unexplained pending the
  next hosted error detail; PR #56 stays open.

Next:
- Run final local checks, commit and push this fix, then inspect the Linux
  index diff and correct its cause before considering merge.

### 2026-09-24 — authority and local workspace enforcement slice

Completed:
- Updated the normative spec, README, adoption guidance, generated guidance, and
  checked-in software/minimal templates: GitHub issues own task scope/lifecycle;
  merged default-branch history owns accepted code; PR checks and merge evidence
  own delivery. Checkpoint pushes are synchronous; CI/auto-merge run
  asynchronously behind required review/check gates.
- Added optional `issue_url` task metadata. GitHub-origin repositories enable
  issue authority at init; active CURRENT tasks require a matching same-repo
  issue URL. Added `continuity issue verify` as a read-only live GitHub check.
- Added a private per-device checkout registry (`workspace register/list/
  unregister`); managed worktree creation searches it and Git registrations,
  reuses one clean unlocked task branch, and stops for dirty/conflicting/
  ambiguous matches. A task-keyed OS file lock prevents concurrent local
  creation for the same repository/task.
- Added deterministic coverage for issue links/live verification, generated
  guidance, cross-root reuse, dirty checkout refusal, and concurrent resolution.

Evidence:
- `continuity issue verify PCM-0024 --root .` -> issue #53 OPEN with matching URL.
- Final full suite: 70 tests passed. Also `continuity validate --root .`, Ruff,
  MyPy, compileall, and `git diff --check` passed.
- `python tests/package_smoke.py --root .` -> wheel and source archive on Python
  3.12 both passed minimal/software generation and PCM-0018 feature parity.
- Issue progress recorded at
  https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5807314523.
- Final local gate update recorded at
  https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5807394746.

Decisions:
- A physical path remains private local state and is never copied into shared
  issues, commits, PRs, or handoffs. The local registry is explicit and does not
  scan drives. Reuse is conditional on a unique, clean, unlocked, same-remote,
  same-task/ref match.
- GitHub task authority is opt-in through `trackers.github`; this preserves
  non-GitHub adopters while making GitHub remotes authoritative by default.
- The CLI/package source candidate is 0.4.0; protocol remains 0.1.0-draft.

Changed:
- SPEC, README, AGENTS, HANDOFF, CURRENT, TARGET_ADOPTION, VERSIONING, task and
  config schema implementations, CLI, templates, and deterministic tests.

Blocked/uncertain:
- Two-user hosted adoption, async PR/CI/auto-merge/issue closeout proof,
  fresh-session holdouts, large-repository stress evidence, and hosted gates
  remain open. This is an implementation slice, not issue #53 completion.

Next:
- Publish this implementation slice as a review PR and continue with the
  disposable two-user adoption, fresh-session holdouts, stress profile, and
  hosted CI/merge/closeout evidence; keep issue #53 open until all pass.

### 2026-09-24 — activation by owner direction

Completed:
- Activated PCM-0024 after the user directed implementation to proceed, reusing
  the existing checkout on `task/PCM-0024-github-authority`; no worktree was
  created.
- Published interim #33 evidence and cleanup status through PR #55. GitHub
  closed #33 when PR #55 merged, so it was immediately reopened with an
  explanatory comment because cleanup is incomplete.

Evidence:
- PR #55 is merged at `e8ec41e16f98e708e967eed5d0bb3f723b1611ed`; required
  quality, Python 3.11/3.12 tests, package, package-parity, and auto-merge
  checks passed.
- Issue #33 is OPEN after explicit reopen; its baseline/candidate reports are
  recorded and cleanup residual remains documented.
- `checkpoints/CURRENT.md` now identifies PCM-0024 as the active task on this
  branch; PCM-0018 is blocked on the separately recorded cleanup action.

Decisions:
- Proceed with PCM-0024 per owner direction while keeping issue #33 open and
  its cleanup/closeout incomplete; do not represent PCM-0018 as complete.
- Keep accepted code and project state in merged Git history; private local
  checkout locations will not be copied into shared records.

Changed:
- `tasks/TASK-PCM-0024-github-authority.md`; `tasks/TASK-PCM-0018-document-discovery.md`;
  `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`; `HANDOFF.md`

Blocked/uncertain:
- PCM-0018 candidate trial clone remains and its baseline directory retains a
  hidden `.git` marker. The automatic review blocked a cleanup operation.

Next:
- Amend SPEC, README, adoption templates, generated agent guidance, the
  machine-readable authority manifest, and deterministic policy/adoption tests.

### 2026-09-24 — authoritative acceptance correction and policy child

Completed:
- Verified live #53 and owner comment 5816655372; allocated leaf #66 / PCM-0025 and automation leaf #67 / PCM-0026 under #53.
Evidence:
- https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53#issuecomment-5816655372; https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/66; https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/67. Accepted baseline at 7762792263779719af03fd13a30b858a05ad120d.
Decisions:
- The owner removed the second-account requirement; old blocking claims are superseded, not erased. Automation #67 depends on policy #66; #33 cleanup is independent.
Changed:
- Active projections identify #66 and correct the owner requirement; historical checkpoints remain unchanged.
Blocked/uncertain:
- Policy delivery gates remain pending in the #66 candidate; broader #53 acceptance is not completed here.
Next:
- Verify required checks and auto-merge for the #66 policy PR, then record receipt/parent evidence; retain #53 OPEN.

## Handoff

Read issue #53, PROJECT, CURRENT, this task, and only relevant policy/test records. Confirm current GitHub state; do not rely on prior chat. Issue #33 remains open for cleanup/closeout, but does not block this owner-directed task.
