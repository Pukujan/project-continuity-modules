- Status: active
- Owner: Codex current PCM-0010 implementation session; GitHub issue #17
- Priority: P0
- Depends on: PCM-0009
- GitHub issue: #17
- Suggested branch: `task/PCM-0010-continuity-bookkeeping`

## Goal

Make continuity bookkeeping degrade gracefully when canonical state is temporarily unavailable, so safe authorized work can continue across one repository/task lineage and an alternate execution checkout.

## Why

Issue #17 records repeated cases where checkpoint/write failures and physical-worktree assumptions blocked otherwise-safe execution. PCM must state that execution outranks bookkeeping and provide a minimal recoverable path when canonical continuity files are unavailable.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] blind disposable-repository reproduction is recorded without exposing the suspected root cause to the test agent;
- [x] execution-versus-bookkeeping and repository-lineage/worktree semantics are normative in the protocol and generated guidance;
- [x] canonical continuity read/write failures degrade to deterministic diagnostics rather than uncaught crashes;
- [x] an authorized alternate checkout can receive a validated recovery receipt without creating a competing project identity;
- [x] recovery receipts can be reconciled into the canonical task once writable;
- [x] deterministic regression tests cover unavailable state, recovery receipt, reconciliation, and existing checkpoint behavior;
- [x] a fresh-session blind rerun of the same scenario passes after the fix;
- [x] PCM-0009 remains separately scoped and its helper-target boundary work is not silently rewritten;
- [x] full test suite, self-validation, and continuity state are recorded before handoff.

Completed:
- Read issue #17, PCM main state, and the separate PCM-0009 candidate branch/PR state.
- Created a disposable PCM-adopted target with an alternate checkout from the same Git lineage.
- Reproduced baseline CLI failure when canonical checkpoint state was unavailable: checkpoint crashed with an uncaught `PermissionError`; baseline preflight also crashed when the canonical task could not be read.
- Ran fresh blind sessions against the disposable scenario.

Evidence:
- GitHub issue #17 -> open PCM-0010 release gate and required blind scenario.
- PCM-0009 PR #16 -> open; branch `fix/PCM-0009-helper-target-boundary`; 9 commits; candidate package version 0.2.0 and protocol version 0.1.0-draft.
- Baseline `python -m continuity checkpoint DCD-0001` against a read-only canonical task -> uncaught `PermissionError`, exit 1, no recovery record.
- Baseline `continuity preflight` against an access-denied canonical task -> uncaught `PermissionError` while validating task content.
- Fresh blind baseline session `01a0cc68-1a32-7860-a5c0-14ce36001dfc` -> completed in primary after changing the read-only attribute; no alternate lineage/recovery was used.
- Fresh stronger access-denied session `01a0cc6b-e1c2-7d53-9764-18d4039820a4` -> completed in authorized alternate and preserved the task lineage; primary task remained access-denied.

Decisions:
- Keep PCM-0009 as a separate predecessor branch/PR and develop PCM-0010 on a new branch based on that candidate.
- Treat repository/task lineage, branch/ref, commit history, and remote identity as authoritative; worktree paths are execution views.
- Record the blind result as a partial baseline reproduction: one fresh agent kept the physical primary checkout as canonical and changed its read-only attribute to force bookkeeping, while a stronger access-denied run succeeded only when explicitly directed to the authorized alternate.

Changed:
- none in PCM; disposable fixtures only.

Blocked/uncertain:
- none; the stronger baseline blind run did not reproduce stopping/permission-loop behavior, so the agent-level result is recorded as partial reproduction while the CLI/validator failure is direct and deterministic.

Next:
- Finish deterministic implementation and run the same blind prompt against the post-fix candidate.

Completed:
- Added degraded-continuity protocol guidance with execution-over-bookkeeping and repository-lineage/worktree semantics.
- Added deterministic CanonicalUnavailable handling, DEGRADED_TARGET preflight classification, recovery receipt schema, checkpoint fallback, and recovery reconciliation CLI.
- Added regression coverage for unavailable canonical state, recovery receipt, reconciliation, and existing append-only checkpoint behavior.
- Reran the same fresh-session blind scenario: the agent used the authorized alternate, did not modify storage or request permission, wrote a .continuity/recovery receipt, and left no ad-hoc checkpoint file.

- PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v -> 13 tests passed.
- PYTHONPATH=src python -m continuity validate --root . -> VALID.

- Post-fix alternate validation -> VALID; recovery reconcile -> exit 0; canonical validation after reconciliation -> VALID; receipt status -> reconciled.

Decisions:
- Keep PCM-0009 as a separate predecessor scope; PCM-0010 adds only degraded-continuity behavior and does not rewrite the helper-target boundary task.
- Push meaningful commits when authorized, but do not make remote availability or a physical worktree an execution gate; a recovery receipt is the explicit local fallback.

Completed:
- Committed the PCM-0010 implementation as b4702df (PCM-0010: degrade continuity bookkeeping safely).
- Recorded the final full test, compilation, validation, and blind-rerun evidence in the task state.

- b4702df contains only PCM-0010 protocol/tooling/task-state changes; no unrelated target repository was modified.
- PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v -> 13 tests passed.
- python -m compileall -q src tests -> exit 0.

Decisions:
- Leave PCM-0009 PR #16 as a separate predecessor; PCM-0010 is ready for review on its own branch.

Changed:
- tasks/TASK-PCM-0010-continuity-bookkeeping.md; checkpoints/CURRENT.md; HANDOFF.md

Blocked/uncertain:
- none

Next:
- Open a PR or perform human review of commit b4702df and its final verification checkpoint.

## Handoff

Read `PROJECT.md` → `checkpoints/CURRENT.md` → this task → `AGENTS.md` → `SPEC.md` → `docs/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` → `docs/BLIND_TEST_PCM-0010.md`. Keep PCM-0009 separate and do not modify unrelated target repositories.
