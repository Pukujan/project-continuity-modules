Promotes the #128 answer; content source: issue #128 body (observed 2026-09-25); diagram rules: issue-log-format 1.1.0 merged at 1e89195.

## Goal

Promote the #128 how-PCM-works answer to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, registered in the catalog, with 1.1.0-compliant diagrams

## Why

The durable in-repo explanation of ownership, checkpoints, resumability, and self-vs-adopter behavior is the missing cold-start artifact the answer itself recommended

Completed:
- Wrote docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (ownership, checkpoints, resume, TASK, self-vs-adopter, doc system; four 1.1.0-compliant diagrams with text alternatives), registered catalog + index, filled task projection, CURRENT active.

Evidence:
- docs add REGISTERED; render RENDERED; validate on this device reports one foreign-worktree error only (/private/tmp/pcm-pinned, detached 8626efa, not created by this session, left untouched); fresh-clone CI unaffected.

Decisions:
- no new decisions

Changed:
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md; .continuity/documents.json; docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md; tasks/TASK-PCM-0043-architecture-doc.md; checkpoints/CURRENT.md.

Blocked/uncertain:
- Foreign linked worktree /private/tmp/pcm-pinned makes local validate INVALID (outside pcm/worktree/<TASK-ID>); owner decision needed to pin-compliantly relocate or remove.

Next:
- PR Refs #134, verify six contexts + merge, receipts, close #134 and #128.

## Handoff

Read PROJECT → CURRENT → this task → minimum relevant spec. Checkpoint before stopping.
