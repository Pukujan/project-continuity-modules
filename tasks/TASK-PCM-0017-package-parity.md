# TASK-PCM-0017 — Prove package version and installed behavior parity

## Human outcome

When someone installs PCM, its version command should tell them which package they actually have, and its initialized project should match what the repository's checked-in tool produces. A successful build alone is not proof that an install works or that it includes the right guidance.

## Baseline evidence

- GitHub issue [#31](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/31) is the authoritative bounded scope.
- At activation on `main` commit `ba315af0`, `pyproject.toml` declared package version `0.2.0`, while `src/continuity/__init__.py` declared `__version__ = "0.1.0"`.
- The repository has required `quality`, `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`, and `package` checks. Its auto-merge job currently waits for those four jobs. PCM-0017 must add artifact-install parity to the merge gate and make the hosted check required where repository protection permits.
- The protocol remains `0.1.0-draft`; this task changes package metadata/runtime identity only.

## External research and provenance

Checked 2026-09-23 against primary documentation:

- Setuptools' [`pyproject.toml` configuration guide](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html#dynamic-metadata) explicitly supports deriving project `version` from a statically declared Python module attribute with `tool.setuptools.dynamic.version = {attr = "package.__version__"}`. Its `attr` reader first inspects the module AST, making a literal version assignment the documented safe shape.
- The Python Packaging User Guide explains that a wheel and a source distribution are different installation artifacts and documents installing archives with pip into a virtual environment: [package formats](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-formats/) and [pip/venv installation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This supports testing both artifacts in isolated environments rather than inferring installability from a successful build.
- GitHub's [protected-branch REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/branches/branch-protection) documents the required-status-check update endpoint. The existing protection requires four contexts from the GitHub Actions app; add package-parity contexts without removing the current gates, then inspect the resulting protection object.

## Scope

Make the CLI/package version single-sourced; add a clear `continuity --version`; build and install both wheel and source archive in clean environments outside the checkout on Python 3.11 and 3.12; compare installed initialization output to source output for minimal and software profiles; and enforce the proof in CI before auto-merge.

Do not publish to PyPI, change protocol version or schemas, migrate adopters, implement Node support, or perform unrelated issues. Do not treat an artifact smoke-test pass as a release.

## Verification plan

- Deterministic version-consistency contract: Python source constant, built distribution metadata, installed import, and console-script diagnostic agree.
- Integration checks: wheel and sdist install in isolated environments on each supported Python version and execute outside the repository.
- Generated-output parity: installed artifacts generate identical paths/bytes to the source CLI for minimal and software profiles, including optional GitHub templates; generated targets pass `continuity validate`.
- Full quality gates: Ruff, MyPy, compile, all unit/contract tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12, package build/install checks, continuity validation, and hosted required checks.
- No fresh-agent holdout is planned: this issue promises artifact/package parity, not that a new session can discover or execute handoff guidance. The generated content is checked deterministically against the visible source contract.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-23 — Task activated

Completed:
- Confirmed issue #31 is open and bounded to package version identity, artifact installation, and generated-resource parity.
- Reproduced a source/metadata mismatch directly from the current repository files.
- Confirmed current GitHub branch protection requires four CI contexts and current auto-merge waits for the same four; adding an install-parity job must update both workflow gating and branch protection when supported.

Evidence:
- Read-only commands: `rg -n "__version__|version|importlib.metadata|continuity init|resources.files|files\\(" src tests pyproject.toml` and `gh api repos/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/branches/main/protection`.
- Observed values: `pyproject.toml` = `0.2.0`; `src/continuity/__init__.py` = `0.1.0`; required contexts = `quality`, `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`, `package`.

Decisions:
- Use the checked-in Python version constant as the package build source of truth, derive project metadata from it, and expose that same value through the CLI. Keep protocol version independent.

Changed:
- Initial task contract and canonical current/handoff pointers.

Blocked/uncertain:
- None. Branch protection can be reconfigured only after the new stable CI context exists and its exact name is verified.

Next:
- Implement the single-source version and isolated artifact parity runner, then run it locally on Python 3.11 and 3.12 before changing hosted CI.

## Handoff

Read `PROJECT.md`, `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`, this task, `AGENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, and `docs/VERSIONING.md`. Do not publish a package or change the protocol version.
