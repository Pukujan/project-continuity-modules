## Goal

Fix the opt-in checkpoint receipt wire format: the post must send a JSON object {"body": ...} to gh api --input - so the shipped receipt path actually posts (Refs #171).

## Why

First production use of --receipt-repo/--receipt-issue on push 2f8dc7a failed with HTTP 400 Problems parsing JSON; raw markdown stdin rejected, JSON wrapper accepted (proof #166 comment 5841406124).

## Allowed files

- `src/continuity/cli.py` (`publish_issue_receipt.post()`), `tests/test_receipt_json_encoding.py` (new), `tests/test_receipt_lookup.py` (contract update), `tasks/TASK-PCM-0055-receipt-json-encoding.md`, `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`, `.continuity/documents.json`, `docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md` (generated).

## Human outcome

A writer who passes `--receipt-repo/--receipt-issue` gets a `RECEIPT: post` line and a real comment instead of a post-push 400 with a retry command that would fail identically; the durable issue-log half of the contract finally matches the enforced Git half. The opt-in route frozen in #67 becomes usable for its only designed purpose.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: JSON wire format at the single `post()` in `publish_issue_receipt` (covers both leaf and parent `run_post` call sites through the injected runner); red-first tests incl. no-network real-subprocess shim; updating the one existing test that pinned raw-string equality (contract change disclosed below).
- Out of scope: default-on receipts / receipt-gap audit (#169 acceptance 2, owner territory); comment length limits; retry semantics changes; any other AGENTS/SPEC prose.
- Dependencies/uncertainty: depends on none; the 400 repro used the real gh binary; shim test proves stdin format without network; a second production success on this task's own checkpoint is the strongest evidence.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Red-first: `tests/test_receipt_json_encoding.py` 2 cases fail pre-fix (raw markdown rejected by `json.loads` / shim-captured stdin), pass post-fix; `test_short_page_without_marker_posts_once` updated to assert `json.loads(payload)["body"] == MARKER`.
- [x] All receipt/checkpoint suites + full discover at known baseline: 259 tests (257 baseline + 2 new), failures = the six known macOS-environmental (worktrees ×4, test_cli ×2); ruff pinned 0.6.9: only the two pre-existing ISC003 findings.
- [ ] This task's own `continuity checkpoint --receipt-repo Pukujan/project-continuity-modules --receipt-issue 171` posts successfully end-to-end (first production use of the fixed path), then PR under six contexts + auto-merge with merge receipt on #171.

## Evidence and sources

- Observed RED pre-fix: `unittest tests.test_receipt_json_encoding` → 2 errors (`JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1`) at product-rev base `0fb5aca`.
- Observed GREEN post-fix: same 2 OK; `test_receipt_lookup` 3 OK; combined receipt/checkpoint/hook/stale suites OK; full discover as above.
- Production 400 + manual JSON success: #166 comment 5841406124 (raw-stdin failure recorded in PCM-0053 task + PR #170 body); defect filed as #171.
- Contract disclosure: `tests/test_receipt_lookup.py:63` previously asserted exact raw payload equality and now passes with the JSON wrapper — the changed pin is this task's intended behavior change, not a regression.
