## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-25 — scorer, fixtures, rubric delivered (parent integrator)

Completed: RED suite (42 tests: 1 positive + >=3 negative controls per T1-T4, purity/determinism/vacuity/append-only properties, M1-M4 metamorphic relations) committed at 14c65a8 (salvaged uncommitted from T46Scorer2, which died on a provider 429 before its first push); GREEN deterministic scorer + 22 fixtures + rubric.json (pre-registered pass rules: 5 arms/behavior, 4 required, ambiguous->inconclusive, controls stay failing) committed at d0f9de7.

Evidence: unittest tests.test_traversal_scorer -> OK (42); ruff All checks passed; mypy src clean; full discover: only the six known macOS-environmental failures (identical at baseline); docs render --check SYNCHRONIZED; validate INVALID only for the device-local foreign worktree /private/tmp/pcm-pinned (pre-existing; fresh clone unaffected).

Decision: verdicts are pure functions over stored artifacts so rescoring never reruns arms; the purity test's dead no-arg score() call (line evaluated via '* 0 or []') was removed as a harness defect, not a contract change.

Blocked/uncertain: none for this milestone.

Next: parent opens PR under required CI + auto-merge; after merge run the 20 hidden arms per docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md and report on #139/#137.

Completed:
- Scorer milestone: RED 42-test suite (positive+negative controls per T1-T4, purity/determinism/vacuity/append-only properties, M1-M4 metamorphic) at 14c65a8; GREEN pure-function scorer, 22 deterministic fixtures, pre-registered rubric.json at d0f9de7; projection filled at e11a569.

Decisions:
- Worker T46Scorer2 died on provider 429 before first push; its uncommitted RED file was salvaged and committed by the parent integrator (durability protocol worked as designed). Purity test's dead no-arg score() call removed as harness defect, not contract change.

Changed:
- tests/traversal_scorer.py, tests/test_traversal_scorer.py, tests/fixtures/pcm0046_traversal/** (22 files), tasks/TASK-PCM-0046-traversal-holdout.md

Blocked/uncertain:
- 20 hidden arms require merged scorer; rubric withheld from participants until then.

Next:
- Open PR for task/PCM-0046-traversal-holdout, verify six required contexts + auto-merge, then run arms per docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md.

## Handoff

Read PROJECT -> CURRENT -> this task -> #139 (method, pre-registered pass rules) -> docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md. Scorer/fixtures/rubric are on this branch (14c65a8, d0f9de7); the 20 arms run only after merge with the rubric withheld from participants.
