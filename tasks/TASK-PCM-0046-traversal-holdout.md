## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-25 — scorer, fixtures, rubric delivered (parent integrator)

Completed: RED suite (42 tests: 1 positive + >=3 negative controls per T1-T4, purity/determinism/vacuity/append-only properties, M1-M4 metamorphic relations) committed at 14c65a8 (salvaged uncommitted from T46Scorer2, which died on a provider 429 before its first push); GREEN deterministic scorer + 22 fixtures + rubric.json (pre-registered pass rules: 5 arms/behavior, 4 required, ambiguous->inconclusive, controls stay failing) committed at d0f9de7.

Evidence: unittest tests.test_traversal_scorer -> OK (42); ruff All checks passed; mypy src clean; full discover: only the six known macOS-environmental failures (identical at baseline); docs render --check SYNCHRONIZED; validate INVALID only for the device-local foreign worktree /private/tmp/pcm-pinned (pre-existing; fresh clone unaffected).

Decisions: verdicts are pure functions over stored artifacts so rescoring never reruns arms; the purity test's dead no-arg score() call (line evaluated via '* 0 or []') was removed as a harness defect, not a contract change.

Blocked/uncertain: none for this milestone.

Next: parent opens PR under required CI + auto-merge; after merge run the 20 hidden arms per docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md and report on #139/#137.

Next:
- Open PR for task/PCM-0046-traversal-holdout, verify six required contexts + auto-merge, then run arms per docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md.
