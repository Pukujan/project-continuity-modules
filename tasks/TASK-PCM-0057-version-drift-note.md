## Goal

Deliver owner decision B on #162: publish_checkpoint prints a version-drift NOTE comparing installed CLI vs checkout version (observability only, no refusal), and bump the package to 0.6.0 so the two 0.5.0 wire behaviors are distinguishable.

## Why

#162 incident: a stale 0.4.0 install composed the sanitizer-bypassing checkpoint; owner chose option B (5842002582). 0.5.0 now denotes two receipt-posting behaviors (PCM-0055 changed wire format), so continuity --version must distinguish them.

## Allowed files

- `src/continuity/cli.py` (`version_drift_note` + one print in `publish_checkpoint`), `src/continuity/__init__.py`, `tests/test_version_note.py` (new), `tests/test_issue_log_format.py` (pin), `docs/VERSIONING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md` (dated note), this task file, `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`, `.continuity/documents.json`, `docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md` (generated).

## Human outcome

A stale installed CLI can no longer silently compose a checkpoint the way `d854175` did (#162): the publish path itself prints which build is running versus what the checkout declares, so drift is visible at the moment it matters, and `continuity --version` distinguishes the pre-PCM-0055 0.5.0 from 0.6.0.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: pure version-drift NOTE function + one call site in `publish_checkpoint`; 0.6.0 version bump with VERSIONING entry and doc claims; red-first tests.
- Out of scope: any refusal gate (owner chose B over A on #162); `--allow-version-drift` flag; recovery-path changes; #169 receipt-audit scope (PCM-0054's next increment).
- Dependencies/uncertainty: depends on #162 decision 5842002582 (recorded); NOTE is cosmetic for users who ignore stdout — accepted tradeoff of option B.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `version_drift_note`: NOTE naming both versions on mismatch; None on match, non-Python checkout, or malformed version file; printed by `publish_checkpoint` on every publish (never refuses).
- [x] Red-first `tests/test_version_note.py` 4 cases: 1 error pre-fix (import fails) -> all OK post-fix; hygiene/retry/stale-base/json-encoding suites 53 OK; full discover 263 tests (259 + 4 new) = six known broken names (test_worktrees 3F+1E, test_cli 2F), zero regressions; ruff@0.6.9: pre-existing ISC003 only.
- [x] Version 0.5.0 -> 0.6.0: `docs/VERSIONING.md` entry (MINOR: backward-compatible safety capability; PCM-0055 changed receipt wire behavior under the old label), ARCHITECTURE current-line, README dated note (pinned evidence table left intact — rewriting cells against a stale pin would be false evidence), pin test updated.
- [x] PR #178 MERGED via auto-merge at squash `bcc0bf3`, 2026-09-26T02:13:21Z, six required contexts green on the exact candidate; merge receipts on #177 + #162; #162 closed as delivered.

## Reproduction details (only when needed)

Base `ff84e91` (#176). RED: `PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 -m unittest tests.test_version_note` -> ImportError (function absent). GREEN: 4 OK; combined 53 OK; discover 263 = six known names. Non-Python adopter checkouts degrade to silence by design (no version file to compare).

Completed:
- version_drift_note() + print in publish_checkpoint (option B per #162 5842002582); package 0.5.0 -> 0.6.0 with VERSIONING entry, ARCHITECTURE line, README dated note (pinned 0b3be9c table left intact by design); red-first tests/test_version_note.py 4 cases; task projection #177 + catalog/index.

Decisions:
- 0.6.0 MINOR (backward-compatible safety capability per docs/VERSIONING.md) — PCM-0055 changed receipt wire behavior under the old 0.5.0 label; NOTE never refuses.
