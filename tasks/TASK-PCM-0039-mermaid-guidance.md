- Status: active
- Owner: owner/Astra planning; subagent execution
- Priority: P2
- Depends on: none

## Goal

Ship issue-log-format 1.1.0: tested diagram rules so every adopter's issue logs, updates and PRs carry readable mermaid diagrams with text alternatives

## Why

Multi-step flows are where text-only records fail hardest; mobile readers get illegible strips from wide diagrams; agents need rules proven against real GitHub rendering

## Allowed files

- `docs/ISSUE_LOG_FORMAT.md` (module doc: marker, Diagrams section, changelog)
- Static guidance copies: `AGENTS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `templates/v1/software/AGENTS.md`, `templates/v1/minimal/HANDOFF.md`, `templates/v1/software/README.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `src/continuity/cli.py` (guidance constants only)
- Version bookkeeping: `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `docs/VERSIONING.md`, `.continuity/documents.json` + `docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md` (catalog refresh/render)
- Holdout scorer + fixtures + tests: `tests/diagram_holdout_scorer.py`, `tests/test_diagram_holdout_scorer.py`, `tests/fixtures/pcm0039_diagram_holdout/`

## Human outcome

A reader on a phone sees a readable diagram where a record describes a multi-step flow, and the record still makes sense wherever rendering fails; a fresh agent given the guidance block produces such a diagram without knowing GitHub's renderer internals.

## Scope and boundaries

- In scope: diagram rules in the `issue-log-format` 1.1.0 module doc and generated guidance; propagation to static copies and templates; version bookkeeping; hidden-holdout scorer and fixtures.
- Out of scope: no diagram renderer in the CLI; no GitHub API diagram validation; no diagram requirement for trivial issues; no new validator error severity (marker scan unchanged); no edits to target repositories; the package version stays 0.5.0 (guidance text only, protocol unchanged).
- Dependencies/uncertainty: none blocking. n=5 per arm on one synthetic scenario demonstrates followability on cheap sessions, not universality; a real-incident rerun is a follow-up and one pass is not repeatability (*inferred* limit, stated in the issue).

## Acceptance criteria

Pre-registered on the issue body (copy of #126 "How we will know"; numeric thresholds as stated):

- [x] **S1 Adoption:** ≥80% of candidate-arm outputs (n=5, fresh subagent sessions, current guidance) pass all applicable deterministic checks: diagram present when the scenario names ≥4 steps; direction TD (or LR within cap); ≤8 nodes; text alternative present; wide diagram inside `<details>`; no viewscreen link. Every individual run ≥60%. **Observed: 5/5 (100%) candidate runs pass all seven checks; each run 100%.**
- [x] **S2 Improvement:** candidate arm passes ≥30 percentage points above the baseline arm (n=5, 1.0.0 guidance without diagram rules). **Observed: candidate 100% − baseline 0% = +100 points; all five baseline runs failed exactly `diagram_present` (zero fences), confirming the rule — not general diligence — drives the difference.**
- [x] **S3 Determinism:** the scorer is a pure function with unit tests (positive control: the guidance's own example passes; 3 negative controls fail as intended). **Observed: 14 deterministic tests OK; positive control passes; three negative controls fail exactly their intended check sets. The holdout itself exposed a scorer false-negative (indented fence lines rejected by `first_statement`/`_LINE_FORMS`): fixed at the root (strip in `first_statement` + line-form match) with a permanent regression test `test_indented_fences_with_branch_labels_pass`; all four candidate fences re-scored green after the fix — no participant output was edited to pass.**
- [ ] **S4 Gates:** module doc, CLI constants, generated + static propagation, staleness warnings, and deterministic tests all pass local gates (unittest, Ruff, MyPy, compileall, `continuity validate`, index sync) and the six required hosted contexts with auto-merge on the exact candidate.

## Evidence and sources

- Source: issue body of [#126](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/126), observed 2026-09-25 (this branch's planning read of the live issue).
- Rendering evidence (browser DOM + screenshots, verified 2026-09-25, disposable matrix `Pukujan/pcm-mermaid-matrix`): [issue #1 probes](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-mermaid-matrix/issues/1), [PR #2 surfaces](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-mermaid-matrix/pull/2), [blob view](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-mermaid-matrix/blob/main/MERMAID_MATRIX.md). Key measurements: 7-node `flowchart LR` = 2120px in an 878px container (scales to fit, illegible on 390px); same content as `graph TD` = 441px; renderer = viewscreen iframe, info probe reports v11.17.2; `<details>` renders lazily after expansion; broken syntax shows a visible "Syntax error in text" panel; standalone viewscreen URL is an empty shell.
- This increment's local gates (run on the branch): `continuity validate --root .` and `continuity docs render --check --root .` results recorded in the PR verification section.

### Hidden-holdout results (run 2026-09-25, recorded before PR)

Design as pre-registered: 10 fresh subagent sessions (5 candidate / 5 baseline), identical instructions, arms differing only in the guidance block (candidate = branch `ISSUE_LOG_FORMAT_GUIDANCE` 1.1.0; baseline = same constant at `origin/main` 1.0.0 — extracted programmatically, lengths 2,261 vs 1,631 bytes, `Diagrams` present only in candidate). Participants saw only guidance + `tests/fixtures/pcm0039_diagram_holdout/scenario.md` (361 words; rubric-vocabulary leak test passes); the scorer (`tests/diagram_holdout_scorer.py`) judged every returned log.

| Arm | Runs | pass-all | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| candidate | 5 | 5/5 (100%) | none |
| baseline | 5 | 0/5 (0%) | `diagram_present` ×5 (zero fences; all other six checks passed on each) |

Process notes (honest limits): (1) the first launch delivered unsubstituted `{{ARM_TEXT}}` placeholders; corrected full prompts were re-sent before any participant produced a final log — no arm ran on placeholder text. (2) A duplicate scorer agent briefly raced the assigned one; parent arbitration settled ownership and the conformant files were re-verified green on disk. (3) One baseline participant messaged an idle non-participant agent about format requirements; no reply was given (that agent stood down by design), and the baseline logs contain no rubric vocabulary — contamination assessed nil. (4) n=5 per arm, one synthetic scenario: demonstrates followability on cheap sessions, not universality; a real-incident rerun remains a stated follow-up. Raw logs and the scoring driver are session-local evidence; the deterministic scorer + fixtures + controls are committed so any maintainer can re-score.

## Reproduction details (only when needed)

Hidden-holdout arms per S1/S2: participants receive only the guidance block + seeded evidence, never the rubric; the scorer and fixtures are committed with the PR. Local gate commands: `python3.12 -m unittest`, `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, `python3.12 -m compileall src`, `PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 -m continuity validate --root .`, `PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 -m continuity docs render --check --root .`.
