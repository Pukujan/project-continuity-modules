# TASK-PCM-0050 — Epistemic bitemporal records decision

<!-- continuity:task {"acceptance": ["Owner selects O1/O2/O3/O4 (or combination) for claim provenance, bitemporal supersession, actor identity, classification, and adopter ticket placement, recorded on #144.", "The five open questions in docs/research/PCM-0050-epistemic-bitemporal-records.md receive a recorded answer or explicit deferral.", "Follow-up implementation issues filed per selection; this task closes as the decision record."], "depends_on": [], "goal": "Decide PCM's epistemic/bitemporal record model from researched options; no normative change in this slice.", "id": "PCM-0050", "issue_url": "https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/144", "next_action": "Owner reads the research note and answers the five open questions on #144; implementation slices fan out only after that.", "owner": "owner/Astra planning", "priority": "P2", "protocol_version": "0.1.0-draft", "schema": "project-continuity.task.v1", "status": "active", "why": "Prose records are consumed as ground truth; without per-claim provenance, valid/transaction time and supersession links, fresh sessions re-litigate settled disagreements."} -->

- Status: active (research delivered; awaiting owner decision)
- Owner: owner/Astra planning
- Priority: P2
- Depends on: none; related #142/#143 (intake gaps that motivated this research), #67 (actor identity precedent), #137 (evidence-vs-claim holdouts)

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-25 — research delivered

Completed: external research (Snodgrass bitemporal model; event-sourcing supersession; W3C PROV/PROV-AQ; MITRE provenance-based belief — all cited in note); in-repo audit of claim/provenance/supersession/identity/classification/pile-up handling; four options O1-O4 with a recommended O2+O4 stance; five open questions for the owner.

Evidence: docs/research/PCM-0050-epistemic-bitemporal-records.md at this commit; issue #144 body.

Decisions: trust derives from epistemic status + evidence + independence class, never filer identity alone; GitHub ID recorded for auditability, not ranking.

Blocked/uncertain: owner decision pending; no SPEC/AGENTS/template edits authorized.

Next: owner answers the five open questions on #144.

Completed:
- Advisory remediation: PCM-0015 S9 prior-art delta addendum; MITRE/USENIX citations corrected to Chapman et al 2010 and Friedman et al 2020; research note + arm plan + three decision projections registered in the document catalog and index rendered; 20-arm plan committed to docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md; CURRENT active_task repointed to PCM-0050; #143 ID correction comment posted (5838709963).

Evidence:
- docs find 'epistemic provenance bitemporal scoped assertions claims' --task PCM-0050 now matches pcm-0050-research (score 28) and prior art pcm-0015-research (16)/pcm-0015-plan (6); previously NO_MATCHES. Product commit at branch head; this checkpoint commits the task projection and pushes task/PCM-0050-epistemic-records.

Decisions:
- O2 reframed as promoting PCM-0015 S9 plus five deltas (valid-time fields, independence class, O4 adopter channel, classification/aging, discovery fallback); discovery defect recorded: task-filtered docs find structurally misses prior art for new tasks until links exist.

Changed:
- docs/research/PCM-0050-epistemic-bitemporal-records.md, docs/plans/PCM-0046-arm-plan.md (new), .continuity/documents.json, docs/CONTINUITY_INDEX.md, checkpoints/CURRENT.md, tasks/TASK-PCM-0050-epistemic-records.md

Blocked/uncertain:
- Local validate prints one device-local error for foreign worktree /private/tmp/pcm-pinned (pre-existing, preserved per policy, invisible to hosted CI). Workers T46Scorer2/T47Hygiene2 running; zero-delta task branches pushed so a dead session is visible as no-work rather than missing refs.

Next:
- Open PR for task/PCM-0050-epistemic-records, verify required CI and auto-merge, then post merge receipt on #144; owner answers the five open questions there.

Completed:
- Branch state reconciled after reviewer caught a lost-then-reapplied addendum: task/PCM-0050-epistemic-records head 81c30e7 now contains the prior-art addendum (PCM-0015 S9 delta), corrected citations (Chapman/Blaustein/Elsaesser TaPP 2010 UNVERIFIED vs Friedman et al.

Decisions:
- Correction to entry 1 (append-only): entry 1 claimed the addendum shipped in product commit e1cb2ce; it actually landed in the amended checkpoint commit 81c30e7 because a branch reset discarded the first uncommitted copy. Entry 1's pushed SHA f3ae58d was superseded by the amend; this entry's push is the authoritative branch state. #144 receipt 5838757901 references f3ae58d and will be superseded by a correction comment keyed to the merge SHA.

Completed:
- PCM-0047 dogfood on the real publish path: this checkpoint's --next deliberately contains close #144; the sanitizer must rewrite it to a Refs form with an operator NOTE, and because tasks/TASK-PCM-0050-epistemic-records.md is cataloged the generated index must refresh in the same commit.

Evidence:
- Post-run checks recorded on #140/#123: commit message keyword-free, NOTE printed, docs render --check SYNCHRONIZED at pushed head.

Decisions:
- Dogfood acceptance line for PCM-0047 (issue 140) executed here after #147 merge; earlier checkpoint pcm-0047-merge-20260925 did not exercise either fixed path (no keyword, non-cataloged file) — correction posted rather than silently replaced.

Completed:
- Second dogfood pass: fresh checkpoint whose next_action embeds a closing keyword, exercising the sanitizer on a real generated commit message (the idempotent retry of pcm-0047-dogfood-20260925 only re-pushed a pre-made commit and proved the index-refresh NOTE).

Evidence:
- Commit message of this checkpoint inspected for absence of effective closing keywords; NOTE printed by sanitizer; docs render --check SYNCHRONIZED at pushed head.

Decisions:
- Dogfood acceptance for PCM-0047 requires the sanitizer to fire on a generated commit; retry path does not regenerate the message.

Completed:
- Third dogfood pass: next_action deliberately embeds the literal keyword sequence close #144 so the sanitizer must rewrite the generated commit message; prior passes proved the index NOTE but never fired the sanitizer.

Evidence:
- Inspect this checkpoint's commit message: expect Refs #144 (no effective keyword) plus the sanitizer NOTE on stdout; docs render --check SYNCHRONIZED at pushed head.

Decisions:
- Sanitizer proof requires a generated commit whose source --next contains an effective closing keyword.
