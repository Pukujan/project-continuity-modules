# TASK-PCM-0038 — Five-family lifecycle evidence (#53 follow-on)

- Status: completed 2026-09-25
- Owner: owner/Astra planning
- Priority: P2
- Depends on: PCM-0024 (child evidence increment; leaf authority stays [#53](https://github.com/Pukujan/project-continuity-modules/issues/53), parent: none)

## Human outcome

The disposable adoption now exercises exactly the five check families #53's acceptance names — lint, type (mypy), test, package (sdist build), and manifest/continuity (`continuity validate` through the installed CLI) — with branch protection read-back confirming all five as required, and a real merged PR green on all five. A cold-start reader gets the evidence without trusting any claim.

## Scope and boundaries

Trial repository `Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle` only (workflows, protection, issue links) plus this projection. No PCM product code changes; defects discovered during the trail were filed separately ([#122] index freshness, [#123] closing keywords). #53 stays closed; this is the last evidence supplement (posted after this projection merges).

## Evidence and sources (observed)

- Protection PUT + read-back: required contexts `["lint","type","test","package","continuity"]`, strict, enforce-admins (trial API response 2026-09-25).
- [Trial PR #9](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/pull/9) head `7730ce3`: all five contexts pass ([run 36138014952](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/actions/runs/36138014952)); merged `862842c569ad99a845ed3593bcfad84222b6e93f` 2026-09-25T13:03:53Z. Attribution: PR #9 timeline shows no auto-merge event (owner-merged after green); auto-merge firing stays proven by [PR #4](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/pull/4) (`auto_squash_enabled`, CONFLICTING refusal, fired at `bd0a9ba`).
- Trial issue #7 (TR-0002 owner) closed with closeout [5832880727](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/issues/7#issuecomment-5832880727); duplicate #8 closed; negative-path #5/PR #6 intentionally OPEN/unmerged as retained failure evidence ([5831842714](https://github.com/Pukujan/pcm-dogfood-0024-lifecycle/issues/5#issuecomment-5831842714)).
- Trial repository re-archived after these facts; links live.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-09-25 — five-family evidence closed

Completed: five required contexts configured and read back; PR #9 merged green on all five; TR-0002 issue link corrected via trial PR #9; trial issue #7 closeout + archive.

Evidence: links above; #53 supplement comment recorded after this projection merged.

Decisions: honest attribution (no auto-merge claim beyond PR #4's timeline); archive, not delete, to keep evidence links live.

Changed: this file only.

Blocked/uncertain: none.

Next: none — see meta `next_action`.

## Handoff

Read PROJECT → CURRENT → this task → #53 closeout + supplements. PCM-0024's acceptance now matches its evidence exactly; continuations live only on [#110] (automation research, no slice released) and [#100] (evaluation adjudication).
