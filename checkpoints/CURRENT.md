<!-- continuity:current {"active_task":"PCM-0008","active_task_file":"tasks/TASK-PCM-0008-multi-repo-content-system.md","protocol_version":"0.1.0-draft","schema":"project-continuity.current.v1"} -->

## Program state

Phase: adoption — prove v1 in mature repositories.

Current P0 task: `TASK-PCM-0008-multi-repo-content-system.md` / branch `task/PCM-0008-close-readme-promotion` / complete; all four README-enabled PRs merged.

## Main objective

Adopt the validated continuity protocol in existing repositories without erasing their domain-specific project contracts or handoff semantics.

## Completed

- PCM-0001 — executable v1 schemas/templates/CLI/validator/bootstrap merged;
- PCM-0002 — fresh minimal end-to-end dogfood merged; 8-test suite passed and final validation was VALID.
- PCM-0008 — four repository-specific README promotions merged after review; all adapters pin content-generation-modules v0.1.2.

## Active

- PCM-0003 — custom-extensions adoption merged in PR #6; the canonical task state is recorded in the prior checkpoint history.
- PCM-0004 — reusable content-generation system is published at v0.1.2; Eval Lab README promotion PR #30 is merged with green CI.

## Queued

1. PCM-0005 — GitHub Issue adapter and bidirectional consistency checks.
2. PCM-0006 — optional Beads adapter.
3. PCM-0007 — protocol v1.0 release/migration contract.

## Blockers

None known.

## Next atomic action

No pending action for PCM-0008. Reuse the v0.1.2 CGM adapter for a future repository when explicitly requested.
