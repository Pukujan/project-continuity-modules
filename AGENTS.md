# Agent Operating Contract

This repository dogfoods the continuity protocol it is building.

## Operating mode gate

Before reading task state, determine whether this repository is the **thing being developed** or only a **helper for another repository**.

- If the user points at PCM to help work on another repository, PCM is helper/tooling only. The other repository is the target and owns PROJECT, CURRENT, TASK, checkpoints, and project-specific operational state.
- Identify the target repository/root explicitly and run `continuity preflight --root <target>` before treating continuity as active.
- Do not create a new continuity repository for the target, do not write the target project's state into this repository, and do not use PCM's own CURRENT/TASK as the target's task state.
- A target is not PCM-integrated merely because it contains similarly named files. Integration is established only when the target passes `continuity validate --root <target>`.
- If a mature target already owns PROJECT/AGENTS/HANDOFF documentation, preserve those semantics and follow `docs/TARGET_ADOPTION.md` rather than replacing them.

Only when the task is to change Project Continuity Modules itself should the PCM read order below be used.

## Read order

Before doing work:

1. `PROJECT.md`
2. `checkpoints/CURRENT.md`
3. the active `tasks/TASK-*.md`
4. the minimum relevant document:
   - normative design: `SPEC.md`
   - handoffs: `docs/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
   - versioning/migrations: `docs/VERSIONING.md`

Do not scan historical chats for context by default.

## One task, one primary branch/session

Task IDs use `PCM-XXXX`.

Recommended branch format:

```text
task/PCM-0001-bootstrap-v1
```

One primary agent/session owns the writable task state at a time.

This is a lineage rule, not a permanent physical-worktree rule. A repository/task branch may be checked out in an authorized alternate worktree or host when execution needs to move. The Git repository, task ID, branch/ref, and commit history identify the work; a filesystem path does not.

## Checkpoint rule

Before stopping after meaningful work, append to the active task:

- completed work;
- evidence/commands/results;
- files changed;
- decisions;
- blockers/uncertainty;
- one exact next action.

Update `checkpoints/CURRENT.md` only when program-wide state or priority changes.

Continuity bookkeeping supports execution but does not gate safe execution. If a canonical task, CURRENT, or HANDOFF file is temporarily unavailable, do not repair storage merely to force a write, stop otherwise-safe authorized work, or ask again for an already-authorized host/worktree. Continue in the authorized alternate checkout and run `continuity checkpoint ... --recovery-root <alternate-root>` to leave a recovery receipt. Reconcile it later with `continuity recovery reconcile --root <canonical-root> --file <receipt>`. Recovery receipts are temporary evidence, not a competing project identity.

When a remote is available and pushing is authorized, commit and push meaningful checkpoint state so the task branch is the durable shared handoff. If the remote is unavailable or the user has not authorized a push, record the exact dirty/local state and next action; do not invent a second branch or worktree identity.

## Evidence rule

Distinguish:
- observed command/test result;
- repository state;
- external artifact;
- agent/model claim;
- inference/assumption.

Never promote an unsupported previous-session statement into project fact.

## Scope rule

If the task expands materially, update/split the task before doing the expanded work.

## Self-hosting rule

Changes to the continuity protocol must be managed using the continuity protocol itself whenever practical. Protocol defects discovered while dogfooding should become explicit tasks/issues rather than silent conventions.
